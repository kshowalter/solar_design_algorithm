# Solar Design Algorithm

Solar (Photovoltaic) Design Algorithm: Instructions to design a permit ready electrical drawing for PV systems for small residential houses.

View the [SDA](SDA.md).

## About this document

This document is being formed to serve as a Standard document released by the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC). It describes a prescriptive way to calculate the details of a photovoltaic system needed to create a permit ready drawing. It will be based on the expertize of the entire solar community (contrators, engineers, AHJ's, and FSEC).

The source document is a simple text document that is used to create a printable PDF, but also directly generate to core of the computer code used in FSEC's online express drawing creation application.

## Contributing to this document

The source document is written in a simple markup language called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This is a compromise between LaTex, which is commonly used to write scientific papers, and a WYSIWYG editor (such as Microsoft Word). LaTex is very powerful, but also very complex, and not as human readable. WYSIWYG editors are more about appearance than content, and it is difficult to get a consistent appearance or extract the contained computer code.

Directly editing the source document requires some knowledge of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) (a version control system), or the installation of a Git application, or the use of an online platform such as Github.

A copy of the [Document](https://github.com/kshowalter/solar_design_algorithm/blob/master/SDA.md), and it it's associated files are stored on Github in what is called a repository. With a Github account, and authorization to work on the project, you can edit it there. You can also create a local copy of the repository with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), probably with one of the [GUI applications](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). Alternatively, you can directly download the [markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kshowalter/solar_design_algorithm/master/SDA.md), edit it on your computer, and send it to someone else insert it into the the version control system. You can use any text editor, or a more specific markdown editor.

Your final option is to redline a secondary document such as the [official pdf document](https://github.com/kshowalter/solar_design_algorithm/blob/master/SDA.pdf), or a version converted to your document editor of choice.
